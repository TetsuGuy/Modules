# Modules
Modules are Short Programs or Batch Files that work and do one thing only. 


Existing Modules:
1) Compressor   : makes RAR-File named after current folder; contains all files inside current folder
2) EmptyDeleter : deletes all empty folders inside current directory
3) BatchEdit    : use it together with MKVnixGUI; used to edit multiple files 





Details:
1) Before it works, you have to set winrar path in cmd.exe: mklink C:\Windows\System32\rar.exe "C:\Program Files\WinRAR\rar.exe"
